	\item The time of beginning and ending of the congregation:
	18:00 - 22:00
	\item Purposes of the congregation:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Install limiters of movement of the crossbar.
	  
	  \item To fix NXT-brick at the robot.
	  
	  \item To train on the control of robot.
	  
    \end{enumerate}
	\item Work, that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item It was installed limiters of crossbar's movement.

      \item It was turned out that metal mesh, on which made bucket, can to hook a lift and interfere with it's movement. To prevent this the bucket was covered by tape. It allowed make it surface is smooth.
      
      \item NXT-brick was fixed at the robot stationary. The new place is better than previous because now it locates higher and it harder to damage it in the event of a collision.

      \item Unfortunately due to working on robot's construction we couldn't train on the control of it.
          
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Results:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Trainings at the control of robot were not conducted.
	  	
	  \item NXT-brick was fixed on the robot.
	  
      \item It was corrected the problem with hooking of bucket during the lift.
      
      \item Limiters of crossbar's movement was installed on the lift.
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Tasks for the next congregations:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Continue the trainings on the control of robot.

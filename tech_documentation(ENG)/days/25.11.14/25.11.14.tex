\subsubsection{25.11.14}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The time of beginning and ending of the congregation:
	17:00 - 21:00
	\item Purposes of the congregation:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To unravel wiers and hold to their by the most accurate way.
		
		\item To increment count of motors, which move the lift, from two to four.
		
		\item Remove the transmission from the mechanism of extracting lift.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Work, that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The wiring has been redone so wire doesn't mixed and not fills too much place inside the robot and doesn't prevent to change of battery.

		\item It was started alteration of mechanism extracting of the lift.
		
		\item Due to that we add to construction two motors it was need to install another one driver of motors for control to their. It was installed in inner space of robot instead the servo controller. Servo controller was installed to more available place because it will be easier to connect additional servos.
		
		\item All drivers of motors was connected to NXT-brick to the port 1. Servo controller was connected to port 2.In accordance with this, initialization of controllers was changed in all programmes.

	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Results: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Wiring was optimized.
		
		\item Driver of motors was installed.
		
		\item Servo controller was installed on more available place.
		
		\item It was started alteration of mechanism of extracting of the lift.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Tasks for the next congregations:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Finish the alteration of mechanism of extracting of the lift.
		
		\item Elaborate concept of the new gripper for balls.
		
	\end{enumerate}

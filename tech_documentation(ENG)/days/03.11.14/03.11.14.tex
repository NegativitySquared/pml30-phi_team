\begin{enumerate}
	\item The time of beginning and ending of the congregation:
	14:00 â€“ 21:40
	\item Purposes of the congregation:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item	Finalize the mechanism of winch.
	  
	  \item Install the drivers for winch.
	  
	  \item	Write a program to control  winch.
	  
	  \item	Fix the the belt using threads.
	  
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Work, that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item	Driver has been installed on the robot.
      
      \item	Actuators are interconnected by a shaft on which the belt is wound.
      
      \item	The belt was sewn from one side to last axe and on the other to the shaft of winch.

      \item	To test the lift we write a simple programm, that can rotate the winch with a maximum speed in each direction or stand still. The movement of the winch was monitored using the right analog sensor.
      
      \item	During the test of the lift, has been found that the drive shafts are not arranged coaxially, that is why whole construction was staggering. It was decided to change the design of the winch so that the spool will be locate on a separate axe, the force on which would be transmitted from drives through the gears with a gear ratio of 1: 1. This would eliminate the problems associated with non-coaxial arrangement of drives shafts.
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Results: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item	The drivers have been installed on the robot.
	  
	  \item	Belt is securely fastened to the mechanism of hoist and winches.
	  
	  \item	Winche has been tested. Found that the two drives have enough power to lift moving apart.
	  
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Tasks for the next congregations:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item	Alter the design of the winch so that it was reliable.
	  
	  \item Connect the encoder to one of the winch drives and add to the traffic restrictions winch.
	  
    \end{enumerate}     
\end{enumerate}

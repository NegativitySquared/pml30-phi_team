	\item Work, that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Preparation of the bucket was changed: it's top part was was minimized so that the formed pipe. This pipe will roll the balls during tipping the bucket. The bottom part wasn't changed.
		
		\item It was decided fix inside the tube plastic bottle to make the balls easier to slide over the pipe. Today we couldn't make it because we didn't have the bottle.
		
		\item Bucket was fixed at STB.
		
		\item After fixing of bucket to robot it turned out that due to transverse beam in front part of robot bucket can't lowers to maximum bottom position. So that this beam was changed on a more subtle, which doesn't prevent to moving of bucket.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Time of beginning and ending of congregation: 18:30 - 21:40.
	\item Purposes of congregation:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Make the programme of control of robot via Bluetooth.
	  
	  \item Choose the optimal way of extracting of lift.
	  
    \end{enumerate}
	\item Work, that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Programme of control of robot was changed. Limit was set so that at low joystick's deviations the robot did not respond. It allows to avoid heavy load to motors when applying for values close to zero.
      
      \item Was carried out connection to robot via Bluetooth.
      
      \item The test of programme successfully. We couldn't make the programme of autonomous period because we didn't connect encoders to drivers of motors. But in competition we'll need encoders.
      
      \item We tested the ability of robot to climb to inclined plane. Robot can climb to hill with a slope angle of 30 degrees.
       
      \item For extracting of lift we decided use the construction of the eight transverse axes (hereinafter they will be referred to as crossbar), that fixed between the slats so what there is one crossbar at the bottom of slate and one crossbar at the top of slat. In this case the cable that fixed at the bottom crossbar and thrown through the top crossbar extract slat.

      \item Instead the line was decided use the belt because it more strong and it can't  entangle.
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Results: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item  Made the programme of control of robot via Bluetooth
	  
      \item Elaborated the concept of mechanism of extraction of lift.
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Tasks for the next congregations:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Buy the belt for extracting of the lift.
	  
	  \item Buy the aluminum profile for making the mounts of crossbars.
	  
    \end{enumerate}

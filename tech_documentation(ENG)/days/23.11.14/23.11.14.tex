\subsubsection{23.11.14 (Competition)}
\begin{center}
	 3-nd day of competition "Robofest-South"
\end{center}
Today there where final matches.

Results of competition:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item By the results of qualifying matches we didn't hit to "top 4".
	
	\item We didn't take part in the final matches because we communicate with other team too little.
	
	\item We won in the nomination "The best engineering book".
\end{enumerate}

Improvisierents that were done:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item It was started programme of autonomous period that include exit from the ramp throwing the autonomous balls to 60cm goal and transport to it to the parking zone. But during the test it was turned out that robot can turn to angle that bigger than a threshold but can't turn to smaller. After returning we need to solve this problem.
\end{enumerate}

Results
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Successfully of performances at the competition:
  \begin{enumerate}
	\item By the results of matces we didn't take the prizes.
	
	\item We took the first place in the nomination "The best engineering book".
	
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \item Useful ideas that we took from another teams:
  \begin{enumerate}
  	
%	\item Другие рейки.
	
%	\item 6 колес.
	
%	\item Винтовая передача.
	
%	\item Свободный энкодер.
	
%	\item Ускоритель мячей.
	
	\item One of the team had a fixture resembling a folding basketball basket that directs to balls vertically. It allows much increase accuracy of throwing balls to the goals.
	
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \item Our mistakes and disadvantages of construction:
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item We did not spend enough time training. It need to more train.
  	
  	\item We communicate with other team too little. It didn't allow to us to agree with ohter team on accession to the alliance.
  	
  	\item During the trainings on the field it turned out that it hard to knock down the fence and mechanism that we planned to make doesn't cope with it.
  	
  	\item Also we decided to refuse from installation of mechanum wheels because robot with mechanum wheels has a lot of problems with riding to the ramp.
  	
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \item Tasks for the next congregations:
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item Improve the programmes of autonomous period.
  	
  	\item Move the axle around which turns the bucket to the top of the slat in order to we can overturns the bucket when the lift is in any position.
  	
  	\item Install to bucket mechanism that will direct to balls vertically. It will increase the accuracy of throwing balls to goals because balls will fall straightly and will not rebounding from the basket bumping against the edges.
  	
  	\item Install on the mechanism of extracting the lift (hereinafter it will call MEL)  4 motors instead 2.
  	
  	\item Improve the gripper for balls: change the couplers to something that captures the balls more securely and less fragile (during the competition a lot of couplers were broke). For example pieces of plastic bottle.
  	
  	\item Practice the skills of effective control of robot.
  	
  	\item To unravel the wires of power of motors and controllers and to hold their more gently.
  	
  \end{enumerate}
  
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Time of beginning and ending of congregation:
	21:00 - 21:30
	\item Purposes of congregation:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item To install guides at the robot.
	  
	  \item To elaborate concept of moving of balls to baskets.
	  
    \end{enumerate}
	\item Work, that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Because our strategy is to carry movable basket for a rear, was decided to install at the top guide axle around which rotates bucket with balls. At the top of the bucket there is tube diametr of which slighly larger than the diametr of big ball. The bucket rotates and the balls rolls to the basket.

      \item It has been estimated that optimal location of the axil, around which will rotate the bucket, it 20cm from the bottom of guide. Additional lifting height allowed to refuse from the one pair of slats. So there is left three slats.
      
      \item The guides were installed to the robot.
      
      \item After installation of guides was decided to test the working of the lift. the belt coped with this task but the axles were bends. It was decided that we need more strong axles. In addition  pairs of slats extracted to the different heights so that it was decided pairwise rigidly to connect the slats.

    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Results: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Guides was installed to the robot. 
	  
      \item It was elaborated concept of the moving of balls to basket.
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Tasks for the next congregations:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Assemble device for rotation of bucket.
	  
	  \item Buy the more strong axles for lift.
	  
	  \item Buy the aluminium profile for connection of guides.
    \end{enumerate}     
\end{enumerate}

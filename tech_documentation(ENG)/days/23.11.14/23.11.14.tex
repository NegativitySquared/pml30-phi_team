\subsubsection{23.11.14 (Competition)}
\begin{center}
	 3-nd day of competition "Robofest-South"
\end{center}
Today there where final matches.

Results of competition:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We didn't hit to "top 4" by the results of qualifying matches.
	
	\item We didn't take part in the final matches because we communicate with other team too little.
	
	\item We won in the nomination "The best engineering book".
\end{enumerate}

Improvements that were done:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item It was started programme of autonomous period that include exit from the ramp throwing the autonomous balls to 60cm goal and moving it to the parking zone. But it was turned out that robot can turn to angle that bigger than a threshold but can't turn to smaller. We need to solve this problem after returning.
\end{enumerate}

Results:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Successfully of performances on the competition:
  \begin{enumerate}
	\item We didn't take the prizes by the results of matces.
	
	\item We took the first place in the nomination "The best engineering book".
	
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \item Useful ideas that we took from another teams:
  \begin{enumerate}
  	
%	\item Другие рейки.
	
%	\item 6 колес.
	
%	\item Винтовая передача.
	
%	\item Свободный энкодер.
	
%	\item Ускоритель мячей.
	
	\item One of the team had a fixture that resemble a folding basketball basket that directs balls vertically. It allows much increase accuracy of throwing balls to the goals.
	
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \item Our mistakes and disadvantages of construction:
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item We did not spend enough trainings. It need to train  more.
  	
  	\item We communicate with other team too little. It didn't allow to us to agree with ohter team on accession to the alliance.
  	
  	\item It was turned out that it hard to knock down the fence and mechanism that we planned to make doesn't cope with it.
  	
  	\item We decided to refuse from installation mechanum wheels because robot with mechanum wheels has a lot of problems with riding to the ramp.
  	
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \item Tasks for the next meetings:
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item To improve the programmes of autonomous period.
  	
  	\item To move the MOB to the top of the slat in order to we can overturns the bucket when the lift is in any position.
  	
  	\item To install mechanism that will direct balls vertically. It will increase the accuracy of throwing balls to goals because balls will fall straightly.
  	
  	\item To install 4 motors instead 2 on the mechanism of extracting the lift (hereinafter it will call MEL).
  	
  	\item To improve the gripper for balls: change the couplers to something that captures the balls more securely and less fragile (a lot of couplers were broke during the competition). For example pieces of plastic bottle.
  	
  	\item To practice the skills of effective control of robot.
  	
  	\item To unravel the wires of power of motors and controllers and to hold their more gently.
  	
  \end{enumerate}

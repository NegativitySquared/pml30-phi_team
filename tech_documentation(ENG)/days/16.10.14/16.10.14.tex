\begin{enumerate}
	\item Time of beginning and ending of congregation:
	17:00 - 21:00
	\item Purposes of congregation:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Connect controller for servomotors and link to it servomotor that rotate gripper for balls.
	  
	  \item Include to programme of control of robot control for gripper for balls.
	  
	  \item Improve the lift.
	  
    \end{enumerate}
	\item Work, that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item To date was bought aluminium strip 100cm x 4cm x 0.3cm for creating of transverse beams for fastening of guides of the lift and aluminium axle length of 100 cm and a diameter of 8 mm for creating of crossbars.
      
      \item Strip wac cut at 4 segments of neded leigth. For installation of transverse beams to guides it was decided to buy Г-shaped profile and cut to it on the corners of needed size.
      
      \item Meter axis was enough for 4 of the crossbar of the required 6. Two from their were installed with elements from Tetrix set. For another one were made holes but it wasn't installed. The last crossbar for the top pair of slats it was decided not to install because we have not yet figured out how to do it and it would make it difficult the improvement of lift.
      
      \item Controller for servos was installed and it was connected to servo of free rotation that rotates gripper of the balls.

	\item Results: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Controller for servo was installed Установлен контроллер сервоприводов.
	  
      \item The programme of control of servo wasn't wrote Программа управления сервоприводом не написана.
      
      \item Aluminium strip was cut at the beams of needed length.
      
      \item Axle was cut at crossbars.
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Tasks for the next congregations:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Buy another one aluminium axle and make the rest of crossbars.
	  
	  \item Buy Г-shaped profile and to make it into the corners for mount of beams to the lift.

\subsubsection{06.10.14}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The time of beginning and ending of the congregation:
	21:00 - 21:30
	\item Purposes of the congregation:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Begin to write a program to control the robot by joystick.
	  
    \end{enumerate}
	\item Work, that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item To test the running gear it was written two programs: straight and around its axis. When it driving straight, it showed good results, because hardly deviated from the original path. During the rotation around its axis robot highly staggered because of the high coefficient of friction of the wheels could not slip on the floor and jumped up and down, but in general it does not affect the accuracy of rotation. The robot was rotated exactly around its center of gravity, but it was not in the center of the robot, but is closer to the rear.
      
      \item  As a result of the discussion was choosen the type of lift - furniture with sliding rails, the base of which is rigidly fixed to the frame of the robot. This design is most reliable from all the above, and the easiest to implement.
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Results: 
	\begin{enumerate}
      \item  Type of lift was choosen.

    \end{enumerate}
    
	\item Tasks for the next congregations:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Buy Furniture slats to create lift.

    \end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate} 
	\item The time of beginning and ending of the congregation:
	19:00 - 20:30
	\item Purposes of the congregation:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Test program of the robot control by two joysticks.
		
		\item Include in the program of the robot control program of management MCB.
		
		\item Replace the gears in the MCB into smaller.
		
		\item Figure out what materials we will design bucket of balls.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Work, that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item MCB takes up too much space, because of the large gear. So it was decided to replace them with smaller ones. Since all small gears have been used, it was decided to remove two of them, that were used to mount the bar on the lift, from the robot. Instead them, we create special attachment

		\item Gears in the MCB replaced by smaller ones.

		\item On the team discussion, it was decided to use (to create a ball's bucket) metal mesh with small cells, because it has sufficient rigidity, but it is easily bent. Also, the grid has a low weight, that is important because it will be rise to 120 cm. Additionally, through the grid cell will be visible, which is the number of balls in the ladle.
		
		\item Program of the management mechanism of the trailer has not been written.
		
		\item Program of the robot control by two joysticks has not been tested.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Results:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The mechanism of the trailer has been finalized.
		
		\item Management program trailer has not implemented.
		
		\item Separate of the robot control program has not tested.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Tasks for the next congregations:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Add to program of the robot control program of the management mechanism of the trailer.
		
		\item Test program of the robot control by two joysticks.
		
	\end{enumerate}
